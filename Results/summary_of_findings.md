# Bayesian Inference Findings

- Inferred gene distributions reflect strong influence from parental gene data. If both parents are known carriers, the likelihood of inheritance increases proportionally.
- The presence or absence of a trait (e.g., hearing impairment) directly informs and narrows the probability space, especially in leaf nodes.
- In data with complete parental and trait information (e.g., family0, family1), predictions are sharper and more confident.
- In datasets with partial data (e.g., family2, family3), probabilities are more balanced, showing uncertainty in gene inheritance and trait expression.
- Mutation probabilities (1%) introduce a small chance of unexpected inheritance, especially when both parents are non-carriers.
- The model demonstrates realistic trait propagation patterns across generations, making it useful for studying recessive and dominant genetic behavior.
